**Prompt:** Spotify Client

## Abstract

We created a game where a user attempts to guess a song that is currently playing. For that, we authorize and login user.
Once he/she is logged in, they search for a playlist or pick one of their playlists. Once the user clicks “Start Game”,
we play a random song from the playlist for 10 seconds (10 is a parameter that can be changed). Once 10 seconds pass,
we display 4 song names to the user (1 of them is the song that was just playing and the other 3 are randomly selected
from the same playlist). If the user selects the correct option, they earned 1 point. The game continues for 10 number
of songs (this parameter can also be changed).

We use `spotify-web-api-js` to login users and get their playlists, `react-toasts` to give user feedback regarding their
selected answer option, `shuffle-array` to shuffle songs in a playlist and generate random answer options for each round.
We also use `yarn` since deploying to Netlify did not work with plain npm (because of a fsevents).
